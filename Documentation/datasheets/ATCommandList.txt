AT+RST						//Restart a modüle
AT+GMR						//Check version information

---Wi-Fi AT Commands---
AT+CWLAP					//List all available APs.
AT+CWQAP					//Disconnect from an AP.
AT+CWSTATE?					//Query the Wi-Fi state and Wi-Fi info
						//current Wi-Fi state
				  			0: ESP32 station has not started any Wi-Fi connection.
				  			1: ESP32 station has connected to an AP, but does not get an IPv4 address yet.
				  			2: ESP32 station has connected to an AP, and got an IPv4 address.
				  			3: ESP32 station is in Wi-Fi connecting or reconnecting state.
				  			4: ESP32 station is in Wi-Fi disconnected state.
AT+CWMODE?					//Query the Wi-Fi mode of ESP32.
						//<mode>
				 			0: Null mode. Wi-Fi RF will be disabled. The ESP32 will automatically connect to an AP if the configuration to connect to the AP has already been saved in flash before.
				  			1: Station mode.
				  			2: SoftAP mode.
				  			3: SoftAP+Station mode.
AT+CWMODE=<mode>
AT+CWJAP?					//Query the AP to which the ESP32 Station is already connected.
AT+CWJAP=[<ssid>],[<pwd>]			//Connect an ESP32 station to a targeted AP.
AT+CWJAP					//Connect an ESP32 station to a targeted AP with last Wi-Fi configuration.
						//<error code>
				  			1: connection timeout.
				  			2: wrong password.
				  			3: cannot find the target AP.
				  			4: connection failed.
				  			others: unknown error occurred.
AT+CIPV6=1					// At present, ESP-AT is mainly based on IPv4 network, supplemented by IPv6 network.To get an IPv6 address, we need to set it.
AT+CIPSTA?					//Query the IP address of the ESP32 Station.

---TCP/IP AT Commands---
AT+CIPSTART					//Establish TCP Connection
						//Single connection (AT+CIPMUX=0):
				  			AT+CIPSTART=<"type">,<"remote host">,<remote port>[,<keep_alive>][,<"local IP">][,<timeout>]
				  			Multiple Connections (AT+CIPMUX=1):
				  			AT+CIPSTART=<link ID>,<"type">,<"remote host">,<remote port>[,<keep_alive>][,<"local IP">][,<timeout>]
AT+CIPSTATE?					//Obtain the TCP/UDP/SSL Connection Information

---TCP Client Commands---
AT+CIPSTART="TCP","192.168.1.57",8080		//TCP Client olarak bağlan

---UDP Client/Server Commands---
AT+CIPSTART="UDP","192.168.1.57",1001,2001,0
AT+CIPMODE=1					//Transparan mod aktif
